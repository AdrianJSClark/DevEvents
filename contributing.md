### How do I contribute?

Contributing to DevEvents is very easy with the GitHub markdown editor; you can do it all from your browser. (You are also welcome to use a standard PR process if you would prefer.)

To submit a change using GitHub markdown editor, do the following:

1. Click the [_Edit this file_ pencil icon](https://github.com/Readify/DevEvents/edit/master/readme.md)
1. Make your changes, respecting the rules below please
1. Use the _Preview Changes_ tab at the top to make sure everything still looks right
1. Scroll to the _Propose file change_ section at the bottom
1. Supply a basic description of your change in the first field (`Add Super Awesome Conf 2019`)
1. Hit the _Propose file change_ button
1. After navigating to the next page, hit the _Create pull request_ button

For content:

- We are only interested in Australian based events, and no earlier than 2016
- The event should be of interest to the dev community (specialist and related topics are fine e.g. AI and agile)
- Please add events in chronological order within the relevant year
- Check any links you are adding are correct
- Ensure dates are in dd-mmm-yyyy format (in case we want to parse this data later). For example, `01-Jan-2019`. Use TBC if the date is unconfirmed or unknown.
- Ensure no additional spaces or formatting characters are present (this will make parsing easier later)
- Ensure states are specified as VIC, NSW, ACT, WA, SA, NT, QLD, ALL, TAS, OTH (Other)
